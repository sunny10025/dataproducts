Project Description
========================================================
This prediction engine utilizes the MARS algorithm to predict the estimated total box office in North America on any given week of the year, based on 
the historical box office data from 2003-2013. The other parameters which it utilizes in this prediction are:
               
      1) Total number of films that will be in theaters in that week.
      2) Total number of theaters in which these films are showing. 
      3) Total estimated production cost for all these films.
      4) Number of Sequels in theaters that week.

MARS Algorithm
========================================================

From wikipedia:

In statistics, Multivariate adaptive regression splines (MARS) is a form of regression analysis introduced by Jerome H. Friedman in 1991.[1] It is a non-parametric regression technique and can be seen as an extension of linear models that automatically models non-linearities and interactions between variables.

The term "MARS" is trademarked and licensed to Salford Systems. In order to avoid trademark infringements, many open source implementations of MARS are called "Earth".[2][3]

Model Diagnosis
========================================================

```{r, echo=FALSE}
library(earth)
x <- read.csv("WklyGrosses.11.22.2015.csv",header=TRUE,sep=",")
fit <- earth(log(x$WEEKLYGROSS)~., data=x, degree=2)
plot(fit)
```

Prediction Accuracy
========================================================
MARS gave us an R-squared of over 79%.

```{r, echo=FALSE}
plot(fitted(fit),log(x$WEEKLYGROSS))
abline(a=0,b=1,col='blue')
```
